# Web-Team-Task
This repo is created as a part of IEEE LBSITW Web Team selection. As a part of the selection, the task was to create a website on our inspiration. I have been following 
Ansh Mehra since 2021. He has influenced me in many was possible. His perspective,consistency and dedication is what inspired me the most.Eventhough he is a recent Youtuber
the impact he is creating his viewers is nothing less than magic. And hence the moment I read about the task I knew who I should make the website on!
